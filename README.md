- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ã–mer Faruk Yerlikaya.
- ðŸ‘€I am interested in Game Programming. In my youtube channel you can watch some of the mechanics I have been coded: https://www.youtube.com/@kardokdelikaya9570/videos
- I use mostly Unity. I get models and animations from Unity's Asset Store and then I program mechanics and make them work together.
